## Gameplay
Each player chooses a race he commands.

Each turn a player can play a single unit (or move detector)

He can  also perform additional actions (upgrade units, build a worker etc.)

At the end of a turn a player produce resources and 
units attack respective units on the opposite side
 * top and bottom units attack the opponent economy  
 if no unit present on  the opponent side of theboard
 * unit on the center attack directly opponent base 
 if no enemy unit on the center.
 
As in the original game units have abilities. 
 * Cloaked units can be attacked only 
 if the detector is present on the board
 * Flying units can be attacked only by ranged units
 * Ultralisk has armour, Carrier builds interceptors etc
 * Yes, now you can launch a NUKE  :rocket: ~nuclear launch detected~~
 
A player win the game when oponent's base is destroyed.
