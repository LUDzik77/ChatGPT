## Gameplay
Each player chooses a race he commands.

Each turn a player can play a single unit (or move detector)

He can  also perform additional actions (upgrade units, build a worker etc.)

At the end of a turn a player produce resources and 
units attack respective units on the opposite side
 * top and bottom units attack the opponent economy  
 if no unit present on  the opponent side of theboard
 * unit on the center attack directly opponent base 
 if no enemy unit on the center.
 
As in the original game units have abilities. 
 * Cloaked units can be attacked 
 if the detector is present on the board (it can be played from the <economy> panel)
 * Flying units can be attacked only by ranged units   etc
A player win the game when oponent's base is destroyed.
