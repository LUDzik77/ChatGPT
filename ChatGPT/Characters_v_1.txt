Use "show not tell" instead of using adjectives
At the end make a long sentence with deep deep psychological sum up


<Party Pooper :D>

Based on the text add title on the top 
Add one line of awesome introduction after the title
Remove  lines Scene 1, Scene 2, Scene 3
3rd party should be 100 words shorter. Add interview by the police.
Don't use Thailand as a word, use association in the description instead. Use it twice in the text.
Also use a word "balls" and "coconuts" in the text
Instead of "causing the reader to stop liking them" show why we should dislike him


Wprowadzenie dodało skrót, a problem logiczny pozostał podobnie śmieszny.


Remove introdution. Instead write one sentence discribing Joanna look.
Then reiterate. first part1 should have 150 workd, part2 300 words, part3 150 words
