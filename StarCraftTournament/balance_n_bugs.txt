::::BUGS AND BALANCE IDEAS::::

attack sound for a Siege Tank (and other units) should be played only if attack not distracted  (now always)
main song should restart after elapsed time, as silence is bad
maybe zerg evolutions should not  take full turn ?
critical dmg to let pierce armour?


::::GENERAL IMPRESSION::::

seems balanced for casual play
